Project Description:

In my project, I am trying to understand the Airbnb market dynamics. There are many ways to accomplish his goal, but more specifically, I will try and predict the best price for any Airbnb given standard measures such as location of the listings, the date of pricing, and the features that Airbnb offers etc. This can take several different forms of projects but my most promising idea is to try to recommend a price for an individual looking to put a listing on Airbnb for the first time. However, we know that reviews play a strong part of customer perception, so I also would like to explore if any given Airbnb is undervalued or overvalued by given historical performance.

This is an interesting project as it deals with many elements of behavioral economics, game theory, and tech industry disruption. As the Airbnb concept increasingly becomes a reality for the hotel industry, individual Airbnb listings and competition are increasing. Hence, it can be very difficult to know, from a hostâ€™s point of view, if each person is maximizing their revenue potential or if they are cannibalizing their own performance by listing their prices too high. Also, it can be very unclear if there may be a substantial benefit for the host to invest in an additional amenity, such as having more bedrooms available or something as simple as providing toiletries. This is something very important for Airbnb as a firm to understand, since their success relies heavily on creating a marketplace that is simple and easy to navigate for current and new hosts.
